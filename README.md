# UPDATE 2/5/2023

After two years of literally no updates to this tutorial, I have finally picked up the skills of web development and now you can find this tutorial on [my website](https://saada2006.github.io/minecraft-shader-tutorials/). However, the code for each shader will remain on this repository. 

I probably won't have time to seriously update and maintain this tutorial until the beginning of 2024. 

# Minecraft Shader Programming

This repository contains information and tutorials on how to write custom shaders for Minecraft using the Optifine mod. The tutorials start at the "Tutorial 0 - Introduction" folder and then the "Tutorial N - ABCD" folders contain information on how to add a certain effect to your shader. The "Tutorial 0 - Introduction" folder is not a shader pack, but the other tutorial folders are. For these tutorials the only requirement is a basic knowledge of graphics programming (you need to know everything up to the concept of rendering to a texture), although I plan to add another tutorial that explains all the basics in detail.

I originally created this project because when I was learning how to write Minecraft shaders, there was little to no information I could find on how to write them. These set of tutorials aims to get rid of that issue for those who want to learn how to write a Minecraft shader.

If you want to contribute your own tutorial, create a pull request. One of my end goals with this project is the turn this into a community effort.

## How to download

First make sure you have Optifine installed and find your `shaderpacks` folder.

If you have `git` installed, first move every shader in your `shaderpacks` folder to a temporary directory, so you can clone this repository into your `shaderpacks` folder and move everything back in.

If you do not have `git` installed, download this repo and move it's files into your `shaderpacks` folder.
