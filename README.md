# Minecraft Shader Programming

This repository contains information and tutorials on how to write custom shaders for Minecraft use the Optifine mod. The tutorials start at the "Introduction" folder and then the "Tutorial N - ABCD" folders contain information on how to add a certain effect to your shader. The "Introduction" folder is not a shader pack, but the "Tutorial N - ABCD" is. For these tutorials the only requirement is a basic knowledge of graphics programming (you need to know everything up to the concept of rendering to a texture), although I plan to add another tutorial that explains all the basics in detail.

I originally created this project because when I was learning how to write Minecraft shaders, there was little to no information I could find on how to write them. These set of tutorials aims to get rid of that issue for those who want to learn how to write a Minecraft shader.

If you want to contribute your own tutorial, create a pull request. One of my end goals with this project is the turn this into a community effort.

## How to download

First make sure you have Optifine installed and find your `shaderpacks` folder.

If you have `git` installed, first move every shader in your `shaderpacks` folder to a temporary directory, so you can clone this repo into your `shaderpacks` folder and move everything back in.

If you do not have `git` installed, download this repo and move it's files into your `shaderpacks` folder.
